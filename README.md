# BrightReminder
A mid-high fidelity prototype of an assignment management system designed by Kobin Kempe, Morgan Oh, Coco Kariuki, Ruining Deng, Hao Yuan, and Cici Wu. This is meant especially to integrate with Brightspace to serve the Vanderbilt community and solve some of the challenges faced by students trying to find assignment due dates and manage grades using our existing platforms. We followed iterative human centered design processes. 
We used JustInMind to make the final prototype. If you do not have it installed, you will not be able to view the file. Included are screenshots.
